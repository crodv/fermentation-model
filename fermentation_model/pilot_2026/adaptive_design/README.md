# Pilot 2026 adaptive MBDoE workspace

This directory owns the campaign-specific model adapter, calibration, gates and
3-2-1 campaign state. It does not issue physical temperature or nutrition
profiles.

## Reproducible entry points

Run from the repository root with the official `fermentation` Conda
environment activated as described in `../../../AGENTS.md`:

```bash
python fermentation_model/pilot_2026/adaptive_design/resolve_historical_audit.py
python fermentation_model/pilot_2026/adaptive_design/build_model_dataset.py
python fermentation_model/pilot_2026/notebooks/build_and_execute_model_ready_qc_notebook.py

The corrected Wave-1 steps require explicit immutable sources; they never
discover a source by directory ordering:

The historical 53-error audit is not rebaselined: it remains 52 raw worktree
size divergences plus one ambiguous generated-results owner. The raw-data
manifest and protected source files are unchanged. Immutable text artifacts
also record their Windows checkout bytes and accept canonical LF verification
only when that canonical digest exactly matches the declared source digest.

## Scientific contract

- Model likelihood tables contain active fermentation only. Cooling remains in
  integration QC and is excluded from kinetic likelihoods.
- The mass-derived 90.435 mg/L pulse remains auditable in integration outputs.
  The owner-approved kinetic basis is fixed at 80 mg/L for each later
  historical pulse; no YAN delivery fraction is estimated. The time-zero pulse
  is already represented by measured initial YAN.
- Oculyze cells are mapped to viable/dead biomass through an estimated nuisance
  conversion with a bounded prior, not a confirmed physical constant.
- Observation errors have explicit absolute and relative terms. Nominal scales
  are frozen while sensitivities are calculated; state-specific model
  discrepancy propagates into posterior/design uncertainty.
- Wine and condensate censoring operators and scales are explicit. Aroma
  parameters outside the reduced Stage-B calibration remain broad in the joint
  ensemble.
- CO2 is fit only for Lots 2-3. Effective sample size is recomputed per run from
  final standardized residuals before residual-weighted refitting.
- Pulses are causal state jumps. At coincident events, the declared
  sample-before-action or action-before-sample convention is applied exactly.

## Calibration and ensemble status

The fixed-YAN reduced calibration in
`baseline_calibration/20260717T153612Z_b5b67b` is computational `PASS` and
release `PASS_CONDITIONAL`. Ten primary fits converged, the selected basin was
replicated, broad starts retained alternative minima, and the residual-weighted
CO2 refit improved its objective. It is a reduced prior, not final model
validation.

The aroma calibration in
`aroma_calibration/20260717T161527Z_e927a5` is `PASS_CONDITIONAL`. Stationary
formation is identified for the three priority aromas; ethyl-acetate loss and
growth-associated formation remain weak and therefore broad.

The deterministic 64-member joint ensemble in
`joint_ensemble/20260717T162323Z_6b9889` passed its gate and represents all ten
successful primary multistart centres. Point-estimate-only design is prohibited.
The Windows environment passed the real Pyomo/IPOPT benchmark in
`hybrid_engine_qualification/20260717T164729Z_c7a6d5`; SciPy is not a final
local solver.

## Final owner-decision Wave-1 outcome (2026-07-18)

The adapter qualification in
`wave1_mbdoe_adapter_v3/20260718T061321Z_b41bbd` is `PASS`. Eight named cases
cover the anchor, both candidate policies, central/low/high-information members,
the critical drying member and a critical actuator case. The independent 9x9
direct-versus-cached FIM comparison, real wine baseline at t=0 and nine
mass-conserving capture intervals all pass.

The multiseed Sobol-PSO plus trust-region IPOPT search in
`wave1_hybrid_search_v2/20260718T074703Z_b41bbd` is `FAIL`. All five seeds,
24 particles and 20 iterations completed with finite candidates; the top five
were revalidated on 64 members, the accepted local proposal improved the
actual objective, completion is 1.0, the minimum action-to-drying margin is
24 h, and all approved actuator scenarios are feasible on all 64 members.
Nevertheless, the search reached its iteration limit without convergence or a
plateau, ranking stability was only Spearman 0.40, and finalists came from one
seed. The local-refinement qualification also fails. These are critical checks
and are not relaxed after the run.

The full-ensemble sampling run in
`wave1_sampling_v2/20260718T080054Z_b41bbd` improves the robust information
score from 21.143 to 22.615, with 63 paired wins and one loss relative to the
preliminary schedule. Its own operational checks pass for ten samples including
t=0, nine contiguous capture intervals, mass conservation, three concurrent
manual samples, sample-before-action coincidence, the 24 h action margin and
the reproducible tank proposal. Its gate remains `FAIL` because its source
search is `FAIL` and the two product YAN mass fractions required to calculate
grams remain unknown. The 50/50 policy is by net YAN contribution, never by
product mass; the CSV publishes the dimensional formula and leaves grams null.
Probe-bias, command-delay and initial-temperature scenarios, independent final
review, candidate-plot owner approval and explicit owner physical-release
approval also remain open release blockers in `campaign_state.json`.

All ten v2 figures in the final sampling run were inspected at original
resolution after two retained layout iterations. Titles, subtitles, axes,
legends and the watermark `COMPUTATIONAL CANDIDATE — NOT AUTHORIZED FOR
PHYSICAL EXECUTION` are legible. This visual QA is not owner approval of the
candidate plots.

The historical regression references
`wave1_hybrid_search/20260717T225010Z_9d52be` and
`wave1_sampling/20260717T231040Z_9d52be` remain immutable. All current results
are computational candidates only. There is no physical temperature/nutrition
profile, tank assignment, or execution authorization.
